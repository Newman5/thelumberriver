        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The Lumber River is a 133-mile-long blackwater river flowing through North Carolina. 
          Designated as both a National Wild and Scenic River and a state Natural and Scenic River, 
          it represents one of the most ecologically significant waterways in the southeastern United States.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The river's distinctive dark, tea-colored waters come from tannins leached from decaying 
          vegetation in the surrounding wetlands. This creates a unique ecosystem that supports 
          an incredible diversity of plant and animal life.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Ancient bald cypress trees draped in Spanish moss stand sentinel along the riverbanks, 
          some hundreds of years old. The river meanders through pristine bottomland forests, 
          creating a haven for wildlife including river otters, wood ducks, and numerous species 
          of wading birds.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The Lumber River watershed encompasses diverse habitats from upland pine forests to 
          bottomland hardwoods and emergent wetlands. This variety supports over 100 species of 
          fish and countless bird species, making it a premier destination for nature observation.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-6 text-river-blue">Conservation and Access</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Much of the river is protected within Lumber River State Park, which maintains several 
          access points for paddlers and anglers. The park works to balance public access with 
          conservation, ensuring that future generations can experience the river's wild beauty.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Whether you're a paddler seeking solitude, a birder tracking migrating species, or 
          simply someone who appreciates the quiet beauty of a blackwater river, the Lumber River 
          offers a unique window into North Carolina's natural heritage.
